# Airman-Database
This is my attempt to learn JavaFX and MySQL.  The goal is to create a database using MySQL that will store information about Airmen in a database.  The information to be stored include name, rank, date of assignment, work center assigned to, and when their evaluation date is due.  I will update this repo as I make progression on the project.

Day 1: created the introduction screen in JavaFX.  Simple GUI with a title, two labels with two buttons allowing the user to add an Airman or to search the database (as of now, the buttons don't have action listeners).  There is also an Exit button at the bottom of the screen that will allow for the proper closeout of the program.

Day 2: Finished creating the screen that will allow the user to input the Airman's information.  This will include last and first name, rank, section to be assigned, date arrived on station, and when his/her preformance evaluation is due.  The user will also have the ability to exit out of the program from this screen as well as go into the search screen (once I have that screen done up).  So far, no major issues encountered, I think I'm moving along well with learning JavaFX, of course, if anyone reads this and would like to add anything to it as suggestions, then I am always open to learn.
