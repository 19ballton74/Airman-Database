# Airman-Database
This is my attempt to learn JavaFX and MySQL.  The goal is to create a database using MySQL that will store information about Airmen in a database.  The information to be stored include name, rank, date of assignment, work center assigned to, and when their evaluation date is due.  I will update this repo as I make progression on the project.

Day 1: created the introduction screen in JavaFX.  Simple GUI with a title, two labels with two buttons allowing the user to add an Airman or to search the database (as of now, the buttons don't have action listeners).  There is also an Exit button at the bottom of the screen that will allow for the proper closeout of the program.
